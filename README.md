Material Google Home
======================
A "material design" inspired Google homepage. The idea behind this project is to create a sort of web-based Google-Now-inspired iGoogle-like homepage for the desktop which follows Google's new material design language.

This is currently very much a WIP and most functionality is not there yet, but with time this should develop into something useful as well as beautiful.

Based on: 
Material UI Kit / HTML + CSS (SCSS) - https://github.com/balajmarius/material-UI-kit
And the original designs done by UltraLinx - https://dribbble.com/UltraLinx
